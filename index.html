       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>As an aspiring web developer, I am enthusiastic about transitioning into the realm of technology. 
        Despite my background in customer service and initial pursuit of a career in Marine Biology, 
        my journey has led me to recognize a passion for the ever-evolving field of web development. <br>

        Over the past five years, I have consistently excelled in my current role, honing valuable teamwork and communication skills. 
        Taking a hiatus from my career to relocate to the Middle East in support of my husband's job in architecture, 
        I seized the opportunity to immerse myself in new experiences. During this time, I dedicated myself to learning Arabic and Muay Thai,
        reflecting my thirst for acquiring new skills. <br>
        
        This venture has affirmed my belief that my true calling lies in a career that constantly challenges me and 
        satisfies my inherent drive for continuous learning. Web development, with its adaptability and innovation, 
        has emerged as the perfect fit. I am now eager to bring my diverse background, passion for learning, and 
        proven track record of achievement to contribute meaningfully to the world of web development.
